As the minio bucket now has subdirectories all existing images need to be
moved inside the minio pod by executing the following commands

```bash
mc cp --recursive local/coffee-images/small/ local/coffee-images/coffee_bean/small/
mc cp --recursive local/coffee-images/original/ local/coffee-images/coffee_bean/original/
```
