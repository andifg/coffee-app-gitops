As the s3 structure gets changed to coffee_bean and coffee_drink make sure
that the s3 bucket notification is in the new format **/original/. The new
format gets automatically created via the minio provisioner. Just to be clean
delete the old listener via minio UI.

# Backend -> 2024-06-27-19-23-6cfa0d2045a3ffe685dafee5e561e80824d31c33

As the minio bucket now has subdirectories all existing images need to be
moved inside the minio pod by executing the following commands

```bash
mc cp --recursive local/coffee-images/small/ local/coffee-images/coffee_bean/small/
mc cp --recursive local/coffee-images/original/ local/coffee-images/coffee_bean/original/
```
