As the rating collection in the database is renamed to drink the existing documents
need to get updated by executing the following command on the database:

```mongosh
db.rating.updateMany({"coffee_id":{$exists: true}}, {$rename: {"coffee_id": "coffee_bean_id"}});
db.rating.renameCollection("drink");
```

Configure the rederict URI for the coffee-app client in keycloak to be /drinks
instead of /feed

As the s3 structure gets changed to coffee_bean and coffee_drink make sure
that the s3 bucket notification is in the new format **/original/. The new
format gets automatically created via the minio provisioner. Just to be clean
delete the old listener via minio UI.

As the minio bucket now has subdirectories all existing images need to be
moved inside the minio pod by executing the following commands

```bash
mc cp --recursive local/coffee-images/small/ local/coffee-images/coffee_bean/small/
mc cp --recursive local/coffee-images/original/ local/coffee-images/coffee_bean/original/
```
